**âœ… To-Do List App â€“ My First Django Project**
This repository contains my first Django project â€” a To-Do List Web App. Through building this project, I was introduced to the core concepts of Django web development and backend functionality.

**ðŸ§  What I Learnet** <br>
Setting up a new Django project and creating reusable apps

Designing and working with Django models to represent tasks

Running makemigrations and migrate to manage the database schema

Creating and using model forms to handle task creation and updates

Implementing user registration and authentication using Djangoâ€™s built-in system

Using Djangoâ€™s login_required decorators for protected views

Building dynamic views with Django templates

Managing user sessions and user-specific task lists

Using the admin dashboard to manage data and registered models

**This project laid the groundwork for my understanding of Djangoâ€™s structure and how it powers robust web applications.**
